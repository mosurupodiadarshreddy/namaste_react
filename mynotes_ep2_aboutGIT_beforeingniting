1)install git get url from google download it for the windows and keep 
2)then go to the terminal of your project folder and run command git init 
3)then create main branch with command "git branch -M main" (create default branch as main instead of master)
4)then create one README.md file in your project folder
5)add something to readme file as of just we kept it as namaste react

6)now lets push code to git 
 	6.1)git add . (it will push all the files)
	6.2)git commit -m "episode-01" (to commit code changes)
	6.3)so  now we need to verify the user details if first time for that follow 
	6.4)git config --global user.name "Adarsh Reddy"
	6.5)git config --global user.email "adarshreddy713@gmail.com"
	6.6)git config --global --list
	6.7)You should see:user.name=Adarsh Reddy
		      	   user.email=adarshreddy713@gmail.com
	6.8)after that git add . and git commit once again now code changes will be pushed 
	6.9)now add Add remote: git remote add origin git@github.com:mosurupodiadarshreddy/namaste_react.git
	✅ 1) Initialize Git in local project
git init


Meaning:

Created a new local Git repository in your project folder

✅ 2) Connect local repo to GitHub (set remote origin)
git remote add origin git@github.com:mosurupodiadarshreddy/namaste_react.git


Meaning:

Linked your local repo to GitHub repo

origin = alias name for remote repository

Check remote:

git remote -v

✅ 3) Tried to push — but SSH key not configured
git push origin main


GitHub replied:

Permission denied (publickey)


Meaning:

GitHub required SSH authentication

No SSH key existed on your system

✅ 4) Checked .ssh folder
dir $HOME\.ssh


Result → only known_hosts present
(No SSH key yet)

✅ 5) Generated new SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "adarshreddy713@gmail.com"


Meaning:

Created secure SSH key pair

Files created:

id_ed25519        (private key)
id_ed25519.pub    (public key)


Location:

C:\Users\adars\.ssh\

✅ 6) Copied public key
cat $HOME\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub


Meaning:

Displayed public key to add in GitHub

✅ 7) Added SSH key in GitHub

Path:

GitHub → Settings → SSH & GPG Keys → New SSH Key


Meaning:

Allowed your PC to authenticate with GitHub

✅ 8) Tested SSH connection
ssh -T git@github.com


Output:

You've successfully authenticated


Meaning:

SSH authentication working successfully 🎯

✅ 9) Tried pushing again — got remote updates error
git push -u origin main


Git said:

rejected — remote contains work you do not have


Meaning:

GitHub already had commits (README etc.)

Local repo needed to pull first

✅ 10) Pulled remote branch safely
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories


Meaning:

Fetched remote commits from GitHub

Merged into local repository

⚠️ 11) Faced merge conflict (README.md)

Git output:

CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in README.md


Meaning:

Same file modified in both:

local repo

remote repo

You manually resolved file in editor 👍

✅ 12) Staged resolved file
git add README.md

✅ 13) Completed merge commit
git commit -m "Resolve README.md merge conflict"


Meaning:

Saved conflict resolution

✅ 14) Pushed successfully to main branch
git push -u origin main


Meaning:

Local branch & remote branch are now in sync
🧾 Meaning in simple terms

👉 Repo name

namaste_react


👉 Branch in repo

main


👉 Your code is stored in

namaste_react / main


Everything is correctly set up ✔️

🚀 From now on (workflow for next updates)

Whenever you make changes:

git add .
git commit -m "your message"
git push


Since upstream is set, git push alone works.
