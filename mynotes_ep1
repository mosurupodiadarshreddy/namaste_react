1)create new folder empty folder open it in the vs code 
2)In that create one new file name it as index.html and in that type html:5 you will get a skeleton html code in that write hello world and execute 
3)After that try to create the hello world program in java script

>>>>>>>>>>
1)once it is done now we are going to create the hello world program in react for we need to import or get react in to our project so react is nothing but the javascript library 
2)Here we are using CDN to get react in to our project it means CDN is third part where react is hosted there and just we are using that react in our project 
3)So once injected that links so now our project have react in it and next go to browser and run this index.html you see empty but open console and type "React" and "ReactDOM" you can see many things react and react-dom gave to our project how beautiful right so try to explore the things also.
4)So now we as developers use this super powers given by react and react-dom and bring this to the large scale application.  

>>>first helloworld program 

Here is the code again:

const heading = React.createElement("h1", {}, "Hello world from react");

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(heading);

✅ 1️⃣ React.createElement("h1", {}, "Hello world from react")

This is how React creates elements internally (without JSX).

It has 3 arguments:

React.createElement(type, props, children)


Breaking it down:

Argument	Meaning
"h1"	Type of element
{}	Props / attributes (none here)
"Hello world from react"	Child content (text)

So this line creates a virtual DOM object like:

{
  "type": "h1",
  "props": {
    "children": "Hello world from react"
  }
}


This is NOT an actual <h1> tag yet.
It’s just a JS object React uses internally.

JSX normally compiles to the same function.

For example:

<h1>Hello world from react</h1>


becomes:

React.createElement("h1", {}, "Hello world from react");


So here:

const heading = React.createElement(...);


stores that virtual element in heading.

✅ 2️⃣ ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"))

This tells React where in the page to place the UI.

document.getElementById("root")

grabs:

<div id="root"></div>


Then:

ReactDOM.createRoot(...)


creates a root container for React 18’s concurrent renderer.

So this line means:

“Create a React application inside the div with id=root”

The returned object is stored in:

const root = ...

✅ 3️⃣ root.render(heading)

This is where React actually updates the DOM.

heading is the virtual React element we created earlier.

React:

1️⃣ Takes the virtual DOM object
2️⃣ Converts it to real DOM
3️⃣ Inserts into <div id="root">

Result in browser:

<div id="root">
  <h1>Hello world from react</h1>
</div>

📘 React Element Creation — Theory & Key Concepts
✔️ What React.createElement() Does

React.createElement() is used to create React Elements

A React Element is not a real DOM node

It is a plain JavaScript object that represents:

element type

props / attributes

children

This object is part of the Virtual DOM tree

React uses these objects to understand:

what to render

what changed

what needs updating in the DOM

✔️ Structure of React.createElement(type, props, children)

type → tag name or component name

props → attributes / properties

children → nested elements / text

Children can be:

a single value

an array of elements

Deeply nested elements are created
using nested React.createElement() calls

✔️ Output of React.createElement()

Returns a lightweight object

Example representation:

{
  type: "h1",
  props: {
    children: "Hello World"
  }
}


This object is part of the Virtual DOM

It is NOT yet inserted into the browser DOM

✔️ React vs Real DOM

React does not directly create DOM nodes

Instead it:

Creates React Elements (Virtual DOM objects)

Builds a Virtual DOM tree

Passes it to ReactDOM for rendering

✔️ When Real DOM Is Created

Real DOM nodes are created when we call:

root.render(element);


At this stage React:

Converts Virtual DOM → Real DOM

Inserts elements into the browser

Applies updates efficiently

DOM updates are optimized using:

reconciliation

diffing algorithm

✔️ Why This Syntax Becomes Complex

Nested React.createElement() calls are:

verbose

hard to read

difficult to maintain

Large UI trees become complicated

Developer experience becomes poor

✔️ Why JSX Was Introduced

JSX is a syntactic sugar over React.createElement()

Provides HTML-like syntax

Easier to read and write

Improves developer productivity

JSX is not HTML — it compiles to:

React.createElement() calls internally

✔️ Summary Points

React.createElement() creates React Elements

React Elements are Virtual DOM objects

They do not create real DOM nodes directly

Real DOM is created only during root.render()

React updates DOM efficiently using diffing

JSX exists to simplify writing UI structures

JSX and React.createElement() produce the same output


****************

✔️ What happens if <div id="root"> already has HTML inside it?

Example:

<div id="root">
  <h1>hello</h1>
</div>


When React executes:

root.render(element);


React will:

Take control of the #root container

Clear the existing DOM inside it

Replace it with React’s rendered content

So yes — the previous content will be overwritten / replaced.

🧠 Why React replaces existing content?

React assumes it fully owns the root container

Anything not created by React
may cause inconsistencies

So React removes existing nodes
and renders only its virtual DOM output

This ensures:

predictable rendering

consistent UI state

efficient updates afterward

✔️ Important Concept

React does not delete the <div id="root"> itself
It only replaces everything inside it.

So:

<div id="root">   <-- stays same
  (React content goes here)
</div>

⚠️ Best Practice

The #root div should be:

empty initially

dedicated only for React

Example:

<div id="root"></div>


Because mixing:

normal DOM content

React managed DOM content

is not recommended.

🎯 Summary (documentation-style)

React takes ownership of #root

Existing content inside root is removed

React renders its virtual DOM instead

Root container itself remains unchanged

React should be the only renderer inside root

so react takes full control of that root id div and clears anything exists puts the virtual dom element in it

** react cdn links should be first it means js is single line threaded so before running our react code the cdn links should be excuted first or it throws react not found error 

📘 React — Library vs Framework
✔️ React is a JavaScript Library

React is NOT a full framework

It focuses mainly on:

UI rendering

component-based architecture

state and UI updates

It does one job very well → building user interfaces

React does not include:

routing

HTTP services

form validation

state management tools

build tooling

Those features come from separate libraries (React ecosystem).

Because of this, React is called:

A “minimal”, “lightweight”, or “UI library”.

✔️ JavaScript Framework (Example: Angular, Vue, Next.js)

A framework usually provides:

routing

HTTP / API utilities

state management

CLI & project structure

build + bundling system

dependency injection

form & validation utilities

testing tools

Frameworks tell you how the entire application must be structured.

React does NOT enforce this — that’s why it’s a library.

🧠 Where can React be used in a webpage?

React can run anywhere in the DOM, not only full pages.

You can mount React:

in header

in sidebar

in footer

inside a widget

inside only part of a page

Example:

<div id="header"></div>
<div id="sidebar"></div>
<div id="footer"></div>


You may render React into only one area:

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("sidebar"));
root.render(appComponent);


React does not require full-page control.

It can be embedded inside existing HTML.

✔️ Why React is flexible?

Because:

React works on a single root or multiple roots

Each root can be mounted independently

It can co-exist with normal JavaScript or jQuery

This is why React is popular for:

migrating legacy apps slowly

embedding widgets into dashboards

replacing parts of UI step-by-step

🎯 Final Summary (Short Points)

React is a UI library, not a framework

It focuses only on view + rendering

Other features come from external packages

React can render:

full applications OR

small parts of a webpage

It can run in header, footer, sidebar, or anywhere in DOM
